# Access-IBM-DB2-on-Cloud-using-Python



This Lab has demonstrated how to create tables in a database, insert some rows of data into the table, invoke SQL queries, and retrieve the query result set.

The ibm_db API provides a variety of useful Python functions for accessing and manipulating data in an IBMÂ® data server database, including functions for connecting to a database, preparing and issuing SQL statements, fetching rows from result sets, calling stored procedures, committing and rolling back transactions, handling errors, and retrieving metadata.
